<h3>Background Information</h3>
<p>My Bachelorâ€™s degree in Political Science from the University of Central Florida has provided me knowledge in government principles and practices. Additionally, my coursework created a strong foundation in research/analysis, and influenced my professional writing skills. I am grateful to have continued my education at the University of Florida and pursue a Master's Degree in Mass Communications with an emphasis in Political Communications.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of my career, I have created extensive relationships in the Florida Senate, House, Judicial and Executive Branches. I hope to continue building life-long connections and strong ties throughout the entire state of Florida.</p>
